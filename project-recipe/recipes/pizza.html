    <p>Frozen pizzas have their time and place, like when we need a backup weeknight meal when we don’t have time to shop or an easy heat-and-serve dinner for babysitters. There’s nothing wrong with a good store-bought frozen pizza in these situations, but making your own homemade frozen pizzas from scratch will probably save you some pennies — plus, you get exactly the toppings you want!</p>

        <h1>What will be going in the Pizza</h1>

        <h2><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound pizza dough, at room temperature at least 1 hour</li>
            <li>1/2 to 1 cup sauce: tomato sauce or other spread</li>
            <li>2 to 3 cups other toppings: sautéed onions, sautéed mushrooms, pepperoni, cooked sausage, cooked bacon, diced peppers, leftover veggies, or any other favorite toppings</li>
            <li>1 to 2 cups shredded or sliced cheese (8 to 16 ounces), such as mozzarella, Monterey Jack, provolone, fontina, or any other favorite</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 450°F.</strong>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven, place a baking stone or baking sheet on the rack, and heat to 450°F.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll out the pizza rounds.</strong> Divide the pizza dough in half to make 2 individual pizzas, if desired. Place the ball of dough in the middle of a piece of parchment paper. Roll it out to your preferred thinness. If the dough starts to shrink back and crinkle the paper, let it rest for a few minutes and then try rolling it out again. If making 2 individual pizzas, repeat with the second round of dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Par-bake the pizza rounds.</strong>Slide the pizza rounds on the parchment sheets onto the hot baking stone or baking sheet. Bake until the rounds are puffy and dry on the top, but still very pale, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Let the pizza rounds cool completely.</strong>Remove the parchment from beneath the pizza rounds and let them cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
            <li><strong>Top the pizzas.</strong>When cool, top the rounds as you would if you were going to bake them right away: Spread some sauce on the pizzas, add toppings, and sprinkle cheese over the top. Note: Pizza rounds can also be frozen un-topped.</li>
            <li><strong>Freeze the pizzas.</strong>Place the pizzas on a baking sheet and freeze, uncovered, until solid, about 3 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Wrap the pizzas in plastic wrap and aluminum foil.</strong>Once frozen, remove the pizzas from the freezer and wrap them first in plastic wrap. Write the pizza toppings on a piece of masking tape and stick the label to the plastic wrap. Then, wrap the pizzas in a layer of aluminum foil. The double layer protects the pizzas from drying out in the freezer.</li>
            <li><strong>Freeze for pizzas for up to 3 months.</strong>The pizzas can be frozen for up to 3 months</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the frozen pizzas.</strong>When ready to bake the pizzas, heat the oven to 550°F (or the temperature at which you normally cook your pizzas). If you have a baking stone, place it in the oven as it heats; frozen pizzas can also be baked on the foil used to wrap them. Unwrap the pizzas, discard the plastic wrap, and slide into the oven. Bake until the crust is dark brown and the cheese in the center of the pizza is bubbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool a few minutes, slice, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
