    <p>It’s a childhood memory I’ll never shake, holding a cupcake in my hand and being overwhelmed by its sheer prettiness. Tentatively biting the rim of the cake before peeling off the paper case and seeing the golden cake in all its glory. Then, when it was all eaten, running my teeth down the paper desperately trying to get any crumbs that may still be clinging to it. Everyone needs a great cupcake recipe in their life, and this is my favourite. It has the perfect balance of wet to dry ingredients and is flavoured by the sweet richness of vanilla extract. Whether popped in a lunch box, simply iced for an afternoon tea or kids party to be stacked as a celebration cake make this your go-to cupcake recipe. You won’t be disappointed.</p>
